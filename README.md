<h1> Readme Generator</h1>
<p>We were tasked with creating a command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md from a user's input. The application will be invoked with the following command:
node app.js

<p> Welcome! When using Github, a readme tells outside people about your project and is important for identification for the app and detailed information and reasoning for specific app programs and coding. 

<p> A command line app allows for a readme to generate quickly and easily- that way you can focus on your coding!
